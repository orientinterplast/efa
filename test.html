                  My entire office team and I appreciated the way they informed the details and answered all queries.
				  It was and Eye opener. We all learnt how we have to be calm and understand the situation, what is the 
				  probable cause and then act accordingly. Simple things to be done which can not only take care of the 
				  small cuts and bruises, but also can save the life of a person.
